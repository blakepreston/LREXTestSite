        <h2>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE</h2>
        <p>
            By using this Website or any other website owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by LREX, you signify your assent to these terms and conditions 
            of use. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions of use, please do not use this Site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, 
            modify, add, or delete portions of these terms and conditions at any time, without prior notice. All changes will be updated and posted on this page.
             Your continued use of this Site or any other LREX site following the posting of changes to these terms and conditions will mean you accept those changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
            You agree to 
            <br>(a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, including mailing and email address, as prompted by the registration form and 
            <br>(b) maintain and promptly update the registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, 
            inaccurate, not current or incomplete or LREX has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information provided is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, 
            LREX has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service (or any portion thereof). Additionally, LREX 
            may terminate your access to the Website, and its services, at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason at all, so long as such reason is not otherwise 
            prohibited by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>Credit Purchases, Invoices and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            Failure to provide required Registration information will result in LREX rejecting an application for credit and other billing considerations or arrangements. All credit 
            requests are subject to review, and acceptance or rejection by LREX, which decision is final in its sole discretion. LREX reserves the right to reject a subscriber for 
            credit or other billing consideration for any cause and without reason. By making a purchase, whether by use of an accepted credit card or through the extension of credit 
            to you by LREX, you agree to, represent and warrant the following 
            <br>(i) any credit information you supply is true and complete; 
            <br>(ii) you are authorized to use whatever 
            credit card you use for payment; and 
            <br>(iii) to pay all amounts accrued in your account, as invoiced, at the prevailing rates and customary charges posted thereon 
            (including charges incurred by others to whom you have given access of your account), together with a finance charge on all unpaid balances which remain unpaid after 
            15 days from the invoice date. Said finance charge shall accrue at the greater of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law; and shall continue to accrue 
            monthly on any and all unpaid balances until payment in full is received by LREX. Your ability to purchase is also subject to limits established by LREX or your credit 
            card issuer. In the event LREX is required to bring legal action against you for the collection of unpaid balances due and owing to LREX, in addition to such unpaid 
            balances and accrued finance charges, you agree to be responsible for LREX's costs and fees necessary and incident to such legal action, including reasonable attorney fees. 
            LREX may, in its sole discretion, decline service to you or terminate your account without notice for your failure to make timely payment.
        </p>

        <h2>Authorized Users and Permitted Access</h2>
        <p>
            Only You and your employees, temporary employees, student interns, associates, partners/members, and contractors dedicated to performing work exclusively for you (to the 
            extent those categories of persons are appropriate to your situation) or others to whom you grant specific permission are eligible to access and use the LREX Website 
            ("Eligible Persons"). The term "Authorized User" means an Eligible Person whom you have identified to LREX for purposes of issuing an LREX User ID and Password (hereafter 
            "LREX ID") and in connection with your LREX Monthly Billing Account. Each Eligible Person who wishes to access the LREX Website must have a unique LREX ID and thus become 
            an Authorized User. You agree that each LREX ID may only be used by the Authorized User to whom LREX assigns and that the LREX ID may not be shared with or used by any other 
            person, including other Authorized Users. You will manage your roster of Authorized Users and will promptly notify LREX, either through the online account management utilities 
            created for that purpose or by direct customer service communication, to deactivate an Authorized User's LREX ID if the Authorized User is no longer an Eligible Person or 
            you otherwise wish to terminate the Authorized User's access to the LREX Website and Materials. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL USE OF THE LREX WEBSITE ACCESSED WITH LREX IDS 
            ISSUED TO YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS WHO ARE CONNECTED TO YOUR LREX MONTHLY BILLING ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ASSOCIATED CHARGES AND SUR-CHARGES, WHETHER INCURRED BY AUTHORIZED USERS 
            OR OTHERS. You will use reasonable commercial efforts to prevent unauthorized use of LREX IDs assigned to your Authorized Users and will promptly notify LREX, in writing, 
            if you suspect that such an LREX ID is lost, stolen, compromised, or misused.
        </p>

        <h2>Restrictions on Use of Materials</h2>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise noted, all materials, including images, illustrations, designs, icons, photographs, video clips, and other materials that are uniquely part of this web site 
            or any other LREX web site are copyrights, trademarks, trade dress and/or other intellectual properties owned, controlled or licensed by LREX. No material from this web site may 
            be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way, except that you may download one copy of the materials on any single computer for

            Modification of the materials or use of the materials for any other purpose is a violation of LREX's copyright and other proprietary rights. For purposes of these terms, the use of 
            any such material on any other web site or networked computer environment is prohibited. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to LREX. Any conduct, which 
            restricts or inhibits any other user from using the site, or interferes with the use of the site by any other user, is a violation of these terms and conditions.

            related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under these terms or otherwise. LREX may terminate any User Account(s) and associated User IDs immediately 
            without notice from LREX if in LREX's sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of these terms. Upon termination, you must destroy all materials obtained from this 
            site and any and all other LREX Web Site(s) and all copies thereof, whether made under the terms of these terms or otherwise. LREX may terminate the account of any user that engages 
            in any conduct tending to interfere with, or interrupt, operation of the web site, as determined solely by LREX.
